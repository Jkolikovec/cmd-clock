# *Welcome traveller,*

to my personal reimplementation of a clock. Yes. A clock.

This clock runs in `Windows CMD` only, as it relies on `windows.h` library.

It has several (2) modes of colour operation - either a day/night cycle or just white.

Zoom your command line to scale the clock up.

Displays time in 0:00:00 European format, even though the `help menu` will tell you otherwise.

Have fun!
